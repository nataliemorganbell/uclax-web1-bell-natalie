        text: "<p><b>Howdy!</b></p><p> We are Alex & Natalie Burton, co-owners and founders of Downhill Design. Our hectic and swirling lives finally brought us together in Octobter of 2021. We traveled on the road in a camper for several years until the time was right for us to buy a home. Life landed us in the small but beautiful town of McLouth, Kansas. There we live on our farm with our herd of cattle, our dog Topher and fat cat Patrick. While getting accquainted with our new home, we've taken on many projects and learned many new skills. Yes, we still have day jobs, but through all of our projects and new skills learned we found a love of creating and crafting together. Thus Downhill Design was born. You may wonder, 'Why name your business Downhill Design?'. Well, we know it's a silly name but the simpliest answer is–we live Down A Hill. We make every piece out of our home and deliver them to you in hopes to bring you the same joy and love it brings us to make them. </p>",

        text: "<p><b>Early Days</b></p><p>Stained glass has been used for thousands of years, beginning with the Ancient Romans and Egyptians. Stained glass windows in Britain can be traced back to the 7th century, with some early examples found in churches and monasteries.</p><p><b>Medieval Glass</b></p><p>Stained glass exploded in popularity during the middle ages, and by the 12th century the practice had become much more sophisticated. Chartres in France became the leading stained glass manufacturer, and the materials they produced were of extremely high quality. Chartres Cathedral contains one of the oldest examples of a rose stained glass window; a circular type of window featuring intricate coloured glass designs.</p><p><b>Renaissance</b></p><p>Stained glass continued to be very popular throughout Europe, and the style moved away from the Gothic of the middle ages into something more classical. During the Reformation, however, many stained glass windows were smashed and replaced with plain glass. This destruction meant that many traditional stained glass methods were forgotten, and were not rediscovered until the 19th century.</p><p><b>19th Century Revival</b></p><p>The 19th century saw a renewed interest in medieval churches, and more churches were built in the Gothic style; including elaborate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the Bible and other religious images. Buildings across Europe were also restored, and a trend emerged for stained glass designs copied directly from famous oil paintings.</p><p><b>Modern Glass</b></p><p>The 20th century saw the development of new stained glass techniques, including Gemmail, a method developed by French artist Jean Crotti which overlaps pieces of stained glass without using lead. Designs also moved away from the predominantly religious, to more abstract, as seen in the distinctive blue, green, white and brown glass of the Cathedral of Brasília in Brazil. </p>",
